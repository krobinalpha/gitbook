# 🖋️ Executive Summary

BondX is a launchpad that enables anyone to create tokens and trade them through a structured on-chain mechanism, with built-in incentives, transparent fee flows, and a clear phase transition into liquidity provisioning.

Key ideas:

* **Multi-chain from day 1**: BondX supports multiple chains under one product, while keeping each chain’s deployment and economics independent.
* **Transparent metrics**: platform volume, fee accumulation, LP progress/phase status, and user tiers can be derived from on-chain state and tracked events.
* **Incentives**: BondX awards points for key actions (create, buy activity, graduation progress), and grants tier bonuses based on cumulative trading volume.

This document is aimed at investors/market audiences and focuses on the economic design and transparency of the system.
