# Executive Summary

BondX is a launchpad that enables anyone to create tokens and trade them through a structured on-chain mechanism, with built-in incentives, transparent fee flows, and a clear phase transition into liquidity provisioning.

Key ideas:

- **Multi-chain from day 1**: BondX supports multiple chains under one product, while keeping each chain’s deployment and economics independent.
- **Transparent metrics**: platform volume, fee accumulation, LP progress/phase status, and user tiers can be derived from on-chain state and tracked events.
- **Incentives**: BondX awards points for key actions (create, buy activity, graduation progress), and grants tier bonuses based on cumulative trading volume.

This document is aimed at investors/market audiences and focuses on the economic design and transparency of the system.

## The “why now”

Crypto users are fragmented across chains, and launch dynamics increasingly rely on measurable trust:

- users want to verify fee flows and platform economics
- creators want distribution and early liquidity clarity
- investors want simple, auditable unit economics

BondX addresses this by keeping the most important metrics on-chain where possible and clearly separating economics per chain.

## What BondX optimizes for

- **Clarity**: explicit fee schedules and phase transitions
- **Transparency**: on-chain tracked volume and fee accumulation
- **Incentives**: points, tiers, and progress rewards for meaningful participation
- **Sustainability**: Phase 2 shifts behavior toward lower fees and buyback/LP operations
