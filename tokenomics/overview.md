# Tokenomics

BondX tokenomics are designed to connect:

- platform usage (creation + trading volume),
- transparent fee flows (treasury / LP / buyback), and
- user incentives (points → BONDX rewards).

Important: tokenomics are **per-chain in execution**, but BONDX token design and its max supply are global design parameters.

This section focuses on:

- BONDX token supply constraints and minting rules
- how points convert into BONDX rewards
- sustainability considerations (supply pressure vs incentives)
