# 💸 Economics

BondX economics are defined primarily on-chain and operate independently per chain.

This section explains:

* fee model (Phase 1 and Phase 2)
* LP listing conditions and phase transition
* points and user tiers (volume thresholds and bonuses)
* how treasury, LP, and buyback flows work

## Phase 1 vs Phase 2 (user summary)

* **Phase 1**: higher total fees, higher points emissions (distribution/incentive phase).
* **Phase 2**: lower total fees, buyback + LP operations active, claiming enabled (sustainability phase).
