# 🔓 Solution

BondX provides:

* **Token creation** via an on-chain factory-style contract
* **Trading** using on-chain pricing mechanics
* **Fee routing and accounting** that is explicit and measurable
* **A phase transition** tied to LP conditions
* **A points + tiers system** based on user actions and volume

The outcome is a launchpad that is easier to reason about and easier to audit:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- users can see key numbers directly (fees, volume, phase)
- the system exposes clear incentive rules
- the platform can publish dashboards backed by on-chain reads plus indexed events

## What is verifiable (without trusting an API)

On each supported chain, key metrics can be verified directly against the smart contract:

- total platform trading volume
- fee accumulators (treasury / LP / buyback)
- per-user volume, points, and tier progression inputs
- phase state and LP listing thresholds

This enables a “trust-minimized” transparency story: the UI can display the numbers, and anyone can check them on-chain.
