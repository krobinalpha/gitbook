# Solution

BondX provides:

- **Token creation** via an on-chain factory-style contract
- **Trading** using on-chain pricing mechanics
- **Fee routing and accounting** that is explicit and measurable
- **A phase transition** tied to LP conditions
- **A points + tiers system** based on user actions and volume

The outcome is a launchpad that is easier to reason about and easier to audit:

- users can see key numbers directly (fees, volume, phase)
- the system exposes clear incentive rules
- the platform can publish dashboards backed by on-chain reads plus indexed events
