# 💡 Investment Highlights

BondX is designed around a simple thesis: **make early token markets more transparent and rules-based**, while aligning incentives across creators, traders, and the platform.

## Why it can win

* **Multi-chain from day 1**: one product experience across chains, while keeping each chain's economics independent.
* **On-chain measurable economics**: key metrics (fees, volume, points) are tracked on-chain and can be verified publicly.
* **Graduation-progress fee tiers**: fee split adjusts as tokens move toward graduation, aligning platform incentives with token success.
* **Gamified participation with a hard cap token**: points are earned by meaningful on-chain actions and can be redeemed into BONDX (subject to token supply constraints).

## What investors should watch

* **Adoption**: creators launched, trading volume, retention, and repeat usage per chain.
* **Revenue**: treasury fee accumulation and conversion into runway.
* **Liquidity and health**: BondXCoin LP bootstrap status and the depth/stability of BONDX liquidity per chain.
* **Token supply pressure**: how many points are minted vs BONDX max supply and the redemption policy.
