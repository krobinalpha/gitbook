# Investment Highlights

BondX is designed around a simple thesis: **make early token markets more transparent and rules-based**, while aligning incentives across creators, traders, and the platform.

## Why it can win

- **Multi-chain from day 1**: one product experience across chains, while keeping each chain’s economics independent.
- **On-chain measurable economics**: key metrics (fees, volume, points) are tracked on-chain and can be verified publicly.
- **Phase-based incentives**: Phase 1 can prioritize growth and distribution; Phase 2 can prioritize sustainability (lower fees, buyback and LP operations).
- **Gamified participation with a hard cap token**: points are earned by meaningful on-chain actions and can be redeemed into BONDX (subject to token supply constraints).

## What investors should watch

- **Adoption**: creators launched, trading volume, retention, and repeat usage per chain.
- **Revenue**: treasury fee accumulation and conversion into runway.
- **Liquidity and health**: Phase 2 activation rate and the depth/stability of BONDX liquidity per chain.
- **Token supply pressure**: how many points are minted vs BONDX max supply and the redemption policy.
