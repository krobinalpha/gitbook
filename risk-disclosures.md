# ⚡ Risk Disclosures

This document is informational and does not constitute financial advice.

Key risks include:

* smart contract risk (bugs, exploits)
* oracle/RPC risk and chain outages
* liquidity risk for newly created tokens
* volatility and market manipulation
* regulatory and compliance uncertainty

Users and investors should evaluate these risks independently.

## Additional risks relevant to BondX design

* **Incentive exploitation**: points systems can be gamed; mitigation must be continuously improved.
* **Reward sustainability**: "1 point = 1 BONDX" requires careful emission and redemption policy to avoid excessive supply pressure.
* **Admin-controlled operations**: certain operations (e.g., BondXCoin LP listing, rewards claiming enablement) may be admin-triggered depending on deployment configuration.
* **Multi-chain fragmentation**: liquidity and adoption can vary dramatically by chain, impacting token dynamics.
