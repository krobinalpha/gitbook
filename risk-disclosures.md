# Risk Disclosures

This document is informational and does not constitute financial advice.

Key risks include:

- smart contract risk (bugs, exploits)
- oracle/RPC risk and chain outages
- liquidity risk for newly created tokens
- volatility and market manipulation
- regulatory and compliance uncertainty

Users and investors should evaluate these risks independently.

## Additional risks relevant to BondX design

- **Incentive exploitation**: points systems can be gamed; mitigation must be continuously improved.
- **Reward sustainability**: “1 point = 1 BONDX” requires careful emission and redemption policy to avoid excessive supply pressure.
- **Phase transition governance**: Phase 2 activation and certain operations may be admin-triggered depending on deployment configuration.
- **Multi-chain fragmentation**: liquidity and adoption can vary dramatically by chain, impacting token dynamics.
