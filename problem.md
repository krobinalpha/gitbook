# Problem

Launching tokens is easy; launching them **well** is not.

Common problems in early-stage token markets include:

- **Opaque fee flows**: users cannot easily verify how much value went to treasury, LP, or buybacks.
- **Liquidity uncertainty**: many launches fail to transition into meaningful liquidity, or do so with unclear rules.
- **Misaligned incentives**: creators and early traders may be rewarded for short-term behavior, not sustainable market formation.
- **Fragmented multi-chain reality**: projects want multi-chain exposure, but tooling and trust often break across chains.

BondX is designed to provide a more transparent, rules-based launch and early trading environment.
