# 🔒 Problem

Launching tokens is easy; launching them **well** is not.

Common problems in early-stage token markets include:

* **Opaque fee flows**: users cannot easily verify how much value went to treasury, LP, or buybacks.
* **Liquidity uncertainty**: many launches fail to transition into meaningful liquidity, or do so with unclear rules.
* **Misaligned incentives**: creators and early traders may be rewarded for short-term behavior, not sustainable market formation.
* **Fragmented multi-chain reality**: projects want multi-chain exposure, but tooling and trust often break across chains.

BondX is designed to provide a more transparent, rules-based launch and early trading environment.

## What “better” means in practice

BondX focuses on:

* **Measurable economics**: users should be able to audit how fees and volume behave.
* **Predictable phase transitions**: clear rules for when the system changes behavior (fees, LP, buyback).
* **Aligned incentives**: reward actions that contribute to market formation (creation, buys, progress).
