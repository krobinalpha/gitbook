# ⛓️ Supported Chains

BondX is a multi-chain launchpad. Current supported chains:

* **Ethereum**
* **Arbitrum**
* **Base**

More chains may be added later.

## Important: per-chain independence

Each chain has its own independent BondX deployment. This means:

* platform volume is per-chain
* fees accumulate per-chain
* phase state is per-chain
* liquidity state is per-chain

BondX may present a unified UX, but **economics do not mix across chains**.
