# 🗺️ Roadmap

This roadmap is presented as an outcome-focused sequence. Timelines can be added once the team finalizes execution targets.

* Harden indexing and tracking reliability for multi-instance backends
* External security review / audit preparation

## Phase B — Tokenomics + incentives rollout

* Validate BONDX reward claiming UX and correctness (1 point = 1 BONDX in 18-decimal units)
* Publish explicit reward and emission policy
* Launch user growth campaigns aligned with real activity (not spam)

## Phase C — Scale and partnerships

* Expand creator tooling and distribution channels
* Add deeper analytics and transparency reporting
* Explore additional chains (post-success on first 3)

## Phase D — Governance maturity
