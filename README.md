# 👋 Welcome

BondX is a multi-chain launchpad built to make token creation and early trading simpler, more transparent, and more aligned with long-term incentives.

This whitepaper describes:

* What BondX is building and why
* How the on-chain system works
* The fee model and phase mechanics
* The points + tier system
* Transparency commitments and how metrics are derived

BondX is designed as a **multi-chain launchpad from day 1**. Each supported chain runs its **own independent deployment and economics** (liquidity, fees, phases, and stats are **per-chain**).

- **Creators**: understand how token creation and growth mechanics work.
