# 👋 Welcome

BondX is a multi-chain launchpad built to make token creation and early trading simpler, more transparent, and more aligned with long-term incentives.

This whitepaper describes:

* What BondX is building and why
* How the on-chain system works
* The fee model and phase mechanics
* The points + tier system
* Transparency commitments and how metrics are derived

BondX is designed as a **multi-chain launchpad from day 1**. Each supported chain runs its **own independent deployment and economics** (liquidity, fees, phases, and stats are **per-chain**).

## Who this is for

* **Investors/market**: understand BondX’s unit economics, incentives, and trust assumptions.
* **Creators**: understand how token creation and growth mechanics work.
* **Traders**: understand fees, points, tiers, and what is verifiable on-chain.

## Supported chains (current)

BondX currently supports **Ethereum**, **BSC (Binance Smart Chain)**, **Arbitrum**, and **Base**. More chains may be added later.
