# ⚖️ BondX at a Glance

## What it is

A launchpad for creating and trading tokens, with phase-based fee routing and a points/tier system designed to reward participation.

## What makes it different

* **On-chain fee accounting**: the protocol tracks accumulated fees (LP / buyback / treasury) on-chain.
* **Phase-based behavior**: Phase 1 focuses on growth and LP accumulation; Phase 2 shifts fee routing and enables buyback and LP operations.
* **User incentives**: points and volume tiers reward consistent participation, not only one-time events.

## Multi-chain model

BondX runs the same product experience across multiple chains, but each chain’s:

* contract deployment
* liquidity state
* phases
* fees and metrics

are **independent**.
